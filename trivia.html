        TENNIS TRIVIA
    </h1>
    <h3>
        Tennis was originated in 12th century France, and is now a internationally popular sport.
    </h3>
    <h4 class="topic" style="width: 8em;">
        History of modern tennis
    </h4>
    <p>
        The racket sport traditionally named lawn tennis, invented in Edgbaston, Birmingham, England, now 
        commonly known simply as tennis, is the direct descendant of what is now denoted real tennis or royal 
        tennis, which continues to be played today as a separate sport with more complex rules. The first Lawn 
        Tennis Club and tournament was held in Royal Leamington Spa on 1 August 1882.

        Play Synopsis
    </h4>
    <p>
        A legal service starts a rally, in which the players alternate hitting the ball across the net. 
        A legal return consists of a player hitting the ball so that it falls in the server's court, before 
        it has bounced twice or hit any fixtures except the net. A player or team cannot hit the ball twice 
        in a row. The ball must travel over or round the net into the other players' court. A ball that hits 
        the net during a rally is considered a legal return as long as it crosses into the opposite side of the 
        court. The first player or team to fail to make a legal return loses the point. The server then moves to 
        the other side of the service line at the start of a new point.
    </p>

        Experience
    </h4>
    <p>
        I started playing tennis in my sophmore year of high school, and have grown to love it. My second year, I made varsity 
        at my high school and almost went to state as a team. Today I play as often as I can recreationally with other 
        friends who share the same love of the sport.
